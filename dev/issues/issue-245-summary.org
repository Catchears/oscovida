Observations:

the unwanted output from the `overview` function in the rendering of html pages
(see https://github.com/oscovida/oscovida/issues/245) can be reproduced with
 with `dev/issues/issue-245.sh` and nbconvert versions > 6.0.1 up to 6.0.7.

 For 6.0.1, it seems to work correctly.

 Will try to pin us to that version for now.

The pinning of nbconvert to 6.0.1 has worked.

I have then tried to use the HEAD of nbconvert (commit e49b9a8a220c9f9f87c23764ea7b48eac4707937 ), and this also fixes the problem.
 nbconvert.__version__ is reported as 6.0.8.dev0

 So when 6.0.8 is released, we should switch back to the most current nbconvert, and all should work.
